"An article about sensouji"
Senso-ji 「浅草寺」  is the oldest temple in Tokyo, and has been very well-known not only by the Japanese, but also by people overseas. 
Kaminarimon 「雷門」 is the face of Senso-ji. This gate is believed to be protected by the Fujin 「風神」, the god of the wind, and the Raijin 「雷神」, which is the god of thunder. That is why this gate has a proper name of Furaijin (Fu(jin) + Raijin) 「風雷神」. Kaminarimon is just a short name for it.
Past the Kaminarimon is the Namisedori「仲見世通り」, which is essentially a shopping street. All kinds of items are being sold here from toy katana(Japanese sword), to youkan(Japanese dessert). This will be a great place to purchase souveniors. My recommendation is a manjuu, a traditional snack. 
After we get past the Namisedori, we see the main hall. Shoukannon「聖観音」 is being enshrined in the site. That is why the main hall has a nick name of "Kannondou" 「観音堂」. Boodists in Japan believe that Shoukannon-sama lives in the world of after-life, and with his forgiving mercy, saves and praises people who suffer from difficult times.
