Traveler's guide + COVID case number dashboard (Specificly for Japan)

!!! THIS PROGRAM IS PART OF AN HIGH SCHOOL IN-CLASS PROJECT!!!

The year of 2020 has been a terrible year with the outbreak of COVD-19. For top-tier athletes, sports fans, and Japanese citizens, the postponement of the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics was another bitter moment. However, the IOC (International Olympic Committee) and the Japanese government have been cooperating closely together to make this highly anticipated event happen. There are obstacles of course, which one of them being the COVID case numbers that are expected to rise, with thousands of foreign visitors entering Japan. The ultimate goal of my program is to restrain this potential threat, by sharing the case numbers of each prefecture, and estimating the potential risk of visiting there. I also plan to implement a guide, which may answer the questions that the visitors often have, such as where to eat, where to shop, how to avoid traffic, what are basic Japanese manners, and etc. Essentially, my program will be a traveler’s guide that shares the daily COVID case numbers.

Key features will be:

  ✧	An easy-to-read graph that shows COVID case numbers.
	
   -	Will be using an API provided by the Japanese government.
		
  ✧	An easy-to-see message that estimates the potential risk of being infected.
	
  ✧	A guide for visitors that answers their most frequently asked questions.
	
  ✧	A guide to popular restaurants, historical monuments, and world heritage sites.
	
  ✧	Give direction to the Olympic event sites.
	
  ✧	Share the Olympic schedule.
	
  ✧ Share the weather forecast for major cities.
	
  -	Will be using Yahoo Weather API
		
  ✧	A checklist that the user can use for COVID self-assessment.
	
  ✧	A list of emergency phone numbers.
	
  ✧	A map that shows the major hospitals and COVID testing centres.
	
  ✧	Flashcards for quick communication.
	
  -	Ex: Where is the stadium? I have a fever. Where is the washroom?
		
  ✧	A link to Google Translate, for more complex communication.
	
  ✧	Multi-language support 
	
  -	English, Japanese; potentially other languages as well, but I will need to use Google Translate for those.

My program will prevent the spread of COVID-19, by introducing features that help the user to avoid the high-risk areas, checklists that help the user perform a self-assessment, and information that are essential to get proper medical treatment. Since it also acts as a guide for the visitors, as it shares information that are beneficial for the visitors to enjoy the Olympic games, and also have a great vacation in the cities of Japan. Since the year of 2020 was an awful year, we must make the year of 2021 to be a much better year, with smiles and happiness amongst all the people on Earth. Successfully holding the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics would be a great step towards that.
